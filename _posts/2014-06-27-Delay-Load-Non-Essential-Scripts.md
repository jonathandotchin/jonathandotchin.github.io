Everyone wants their page to be popular on social networks, but social network scripts tend to be large and can cause sluggish response for the user. Waiting until the page has loaded before [requesting these scripts](http://www.aaronpeters.nl/blog/why-loading-third-party-scripts-async-is-not-good-enough) can make the page responsive sooner.
