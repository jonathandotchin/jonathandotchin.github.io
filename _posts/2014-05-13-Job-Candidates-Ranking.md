In this post, we will examine a simple job candidates ranking system that was put in place in our team in order to quickly decide if we want to move forward with certains applicants.

# Background

In our team, whenever we are interviewing candidates we often looks for more than simply the technical aspects. We want to answer question such as 'does this person have a good head', 'how driven is this person', 'would this candidate be a good fit in the team', etc. We thought of making a long list of criteria and simply attribute score to each of them. But how would weight a 'good head' against 'team player'. What if the applicant got one but not the other? Would someone with lots of passion and drive overweight a lackluster team player? In the end, we came up with a simple ranking system that would take into account all the criteria that an interviewer feels are important.

# The Ranking System

The ranking system is rather simple. Candidates are given a simple score of 1 to 4.

## Score of 1

Like any extreme, a score of 1 is fairly simple to understand. You would rate an application 1 if you simply do not want to have that person in your team. It is as simple as that. There could have been a million reasons or there could have been only one but it was a red flag but you o not think it will work if this person in your team.

## Score of 2

A score of 2 means that you are unsure. You simply do not know what to do with the candidate. In this case, you simply do not want to move forward since 

## Score of 3

This is where it gets interesting. A candidate rated 3 is a candidate that you do not see any reason why you should not hire them. No red flag.

## Score of 4

The other extreme is also an easy one. You would rate an application 4 when not only you want but would need this applicant in your team. Obviously, rating candidate 4 means that you saw something rather extraordinary and you should hire the applicant.

# Conclusion

We recently put this in place. Time will tell how this system works out.
