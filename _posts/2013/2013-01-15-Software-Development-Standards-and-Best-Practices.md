The software development standards and best practices not only define the working methods but also the tools that facilitate the life of developers. This document intends to harmonize the ecosystem of software development in our workplace and will be updated when necessary.

# The "3 + 1" pillars
To ensure the success of the software development standards and best practices, the following criteria must be kept in mind when they are established.

## Adhesion
Everyone must adhere and be comfortable with the defined standards.

## Adaptation
Nothing is perfect; need to adapt the standards required.

## Automation
If possible, application of standards automation will allow developers to work on more important things.

## Respect
Respect the standards already in placed

# Development Framework

# Components and libraries

## Summary

- It is recommended to use libraries and components that are directly available via NuGet for ease and automation of installation and configuration.
- If the libraries and components are not available in NuGet, they should be included directly in the project and be submitted in Perforce under the **ExtLibs** folder.

It is therefore inferior than the library that are actively maintained by the community. Furthermore, setting up MSTest to run on a build machine as part of a CI system is a pain. You basically need to install Visual Studio to get it working. - xUnit.net is a new test library that is very simple and very fast. However, it lacks traction in the world of continous integration. Some tool such as AnthillPro used by us does not support by default. |
