The software development standards and best practices not only define the working methods but also the tools that facilitate the life of developers. This document intends to harmonize the ecosystem of software development in our workplace and will be updated when necessary.

# The "3 + 1" pillars
To ensure the success of the software development standards and best practices, the following criteria must be kept in mind when they are established.

## Adhesion
Everyone must adhere and be comfortable with the defined standards.

## Adaptation
Nothing is perfect; need to adapt the standards required.

## Automation
If possible, application of standards automation will allow developers to work on more important things.

## Respect
Respect the standards already in placed

# Development Framework
