As developers, we often want to fix problems with code, but don’t be afraid to ‘put the compiler down’ and throw some hardware at the problem. Performance problems caused by disk I/O bottlenecks or paging out of RAM can often be solved by a faster hard drive or more RAM. CPU bound bottlenecks can often be solved by a new machine with a faster processor. As counterintuitive as it sounds, addressing problems by buying a new machine or upgrading an aging one is often much cheaper than having a developer troubleshoot, diagnose, and correct a deep performance problem. And the rest of your website will get a performance kick to boot!
