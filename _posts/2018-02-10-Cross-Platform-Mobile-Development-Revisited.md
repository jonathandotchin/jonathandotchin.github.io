This post documents the different technologies investigated for cross-platform mobile development.

# Background

This post documents the findings related to each technology investigated for cross-platform mobile development. As more features are investigated, this post will be updated in consequence.

Back in 2015, I did a comparison between a native solution in Xamarin and a hybrid solution in Cordova. Today, I will do the same exercise with PWA (Progressive Web App). For a quick intro to PWA, visit this [blog](http://blog.ionicframework.com/what-is-a-progressive-web-app/) from ionic.

You can use the IDE of your choice provided it has proper web development features. What will be called upon are tools to help you debug PWA. At this point, the best tools are the Chrome browser with its devtools [Building your first PWA](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/) which includes a local server and PWA validator called Lighthouse.|Xamarin/PWA|

|UI Styling|[Styling](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/styles/) in Xamarin.Forms is similiar to XAML Styling <br/> Xamarin.Forms renders elements using native element. If you want to change the look and feel, you will need [Custom Renderer](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/custom-renderer/)<br/>Since Xamarin translate to native UI, the styling is often correct. Otherwise, customer renderer can help but it is not perfect|Classic CSS Style Sheets<br/>Make sure your CSS is supported equally among all browsers, which could be quite challenging.

# Decision Tree

.NET developer should be favouring Xamarin over Apache Cordova and PWA whereas JavaScript developer should be doing the opposite. Currently, PWA works only on Android devices. However, both Microsoft and Apple are aggresively pushing it on their platforms. With the advances of PWA, Apache Cordova is basically a dead framework. JavaScript developer should be favoring PWA to make their application future proof.
