It’s easy to get excited every time a new and cool feature comes out but some of these may still be experimental with the specification still under development. It’s important to remember that features that are in the early stages of specification development are very likely to change, which could impact your site’s stability and your customer’s experience. By focusing on stable standards, you’re ensuring that your customers will be able to have the experience they’re expecting and your site will be more maintainable.
