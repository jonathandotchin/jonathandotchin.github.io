Simple id and class selectors are useful, but using them exclusively means the markup gets messier and less reusable with unnecessary ids and classes. Using tag, descendant, child, sibling, and attribute selectors in combination with a small number of ids and classes can keep both the markup and CSS simpler and more general. Avoid the use of the "!important" rule at all costs.
