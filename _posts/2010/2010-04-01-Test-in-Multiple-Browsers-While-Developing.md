Although modern browsers are much closer to a single standard than ever before, differences still exist. An occasional multi-browser sanity checkpoint during development can ensure that serious cross-browser issues don't crop up at the last minute â€“ or worse yet, after it's all public. Be sure to look in each browser's console like the F12 Dev Tools in IE to see if any error or warning messages appear. For older browsers like IE7 that don't have a built-in console, you can use Firebug Lite to provide one. Or use a cross-browser hosted testing solution like BrowserStack.
