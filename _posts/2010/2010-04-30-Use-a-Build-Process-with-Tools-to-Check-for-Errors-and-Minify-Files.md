A good set of build tools such as HTML validators, CSS validators, Uglify, and JSHint, or GruntJS can find latent problems, enforce project code standards, and reduce file size to improve performance. These steps don't have to be a roadblock if your IDE or code-editor supports them. Visual Studio, for example, provides the ability to run external tools and combine/compress script files during its build process.
