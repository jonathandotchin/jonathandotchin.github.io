The following provides a description of the workflow use during the design of the OWMM service. It focuses mainly on the design docs that will be the foundation of the coding to be done at a later stage of development.

# Steps

## Initial Design

In this stage, the designer works in solo. The idea is to explore the subject in order to gain a certain level of understanding and to come up with a preliminary design or solution.

## Group Brainstorm

Here, we involve multiple persons in the form of a brainstorm. It is recommended to involve people of multiple background such that one can gather as much opinions as possible. The role of a devil's advocate is important.

## Polish

After gathering inputs from multiple actors, the design is polished and readied for the next stage.

## Stakeholders Review

As a final step, the stakeholders are presented the design. Questions are answered and clarifications are made.

# Addendum

Note that each steps may be repeated as much as necessary in order to get things right.
