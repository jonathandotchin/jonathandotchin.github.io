This post documents how to use a README.md appear as the welcome page when loading a solution in Visual Studio.

# Overview

README.md is a readme file written in the markdown language that presents information about the project popularized by GitHub. An example can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/home. This guide provides instructions on how to make the README.md file appear when loading a solution in Visual Studio.

# Requirements
    1. A README.md saved at the solution level
    2. Install the Visual Studio Extension called WelcomePage

# Limitations

## Preview

Visual Studio does not have a markdown editor integrated by default. However, you can install Web Essentials to obtain the requested features.

## Image

Local images are not supported. The images need to be loaded from a web server such as confluence.
