This post documents the different mobile apps investigated for tracking my workout.

# Background

Currently, I am still using paper and pencil to track my workout. But I wanted to "modernize" and use a digital version. I thought about building my own but, before doing that, I figure it would be worthwhile to investigate what’s already out there. Since I am currently using an Android device, I will focus solely on the Android platform.

# Criteria

The following are the criteria that I am going to use to evaluate each app. A brief description will be provided for each of them followed by whether it is a must have or a nice to have.

## Routine

A routine is basically a group of exercise to be executed during a workout session.

### Premade

Premade routines are often routine that have been made popular by fitness coach. For example, the 5x5x5 workout session. It is a nice to have for both beginners and advanced users. 

### Custom

Custom routines allow the user to enter their own workout routine. This is a must since, whether you found a session online or given to you by your coach, you would want to input it. 

### History

Often, we want to revisit a past exercise routine. Having a history built in is a nice to have.

## Exercise

An exercise is exactly what it is. It could be with or without weights or with a machine.

### Database

When we are building our own custom routine, to be able to choose exercise from a database is a must have.

### Demo

Having a demo of the exercise within the database is a must have. Doing the exercise properly not only increase its effectiveness but most importantly avoids injuries.

### History

This one is tricky but I consider it to be a must have. In essence, the idea is that you should be to know how much weights you used for the same exercise in the previous session and routine.

## Interface

In essence, this represents the look and feel of the application.

### Modern

A slick application is just easier to use and It is more comfortable to the eyes. Therefore, this is a must have. Ads, if it is present, should not affect the natural flow of the application. It is simply annoying when we want to click something but ads suddenly appear and we click on it by accident. Therefore, this is a must have.

## Storage

Storage represents where the information about your workout is stored.

### Phone

Locally on the phone. This is a must have since not all gym has WiFi and you don’t want to burn your data plan.

### Cloud

This is tricky but a must have. I would hate for my history to be lost if I change phone.

## Price

Usually, an app is either free, ads supported, freemium or paid.
