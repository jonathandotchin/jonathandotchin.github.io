NTttcp (a Winsock-based port of BSDâ€™s TTCP tool) is a useful tool to help measure overall Windows networking performance with a multitude of networking adapters in different configurations.

For example, to measure the network performance between two multi-core serves running Windows Server 2012, NODE1 (192.168.0.1) and NODE2 (192.168.0.2), connected via a 10GigE connection, on NODE1 (the sender), run:

ntttcp.exe -s -m 8,*,192.168.0.2 -l 128k -a 2 -t 15
(Translation: Run ntttcp.exe as a sender, with eight threads dynamically allocated across all cores targeting 192.168.0.2, allocating a 128K buffer length and operating in asynchronous mode with 2 posted send overlapped buffers per thread for 15 seconds.)

And on NODE2 (the receiver), run:

ntttcp.exe -r -m 8,*,192.168.0.2 -rb 2M -a 16 -t 15
(Translation: Run ntttcp.exe as a receiver, with eight threads dynamically allocated across all cores listening on 192.168.0.2, allocating 64KB buffers [since -l is not specified], a 2MB SO_RCVBUF Winsock buffer and operating in asynchronous mode with 16 posted receive overlapped buffers per thread for 15 seconds.)

Using the above parameters, the program returns results on both the sender and receiver nodes, correlating network communication to CPU utilization.  Example sender-side output from a given run (which showcases a fully saturated 10GigE connection at 1131.4 MB/s):

D:\>NTttcp.exe -s -m 8,*,192.168.0.2 -l 128k -a 2 -t 15
